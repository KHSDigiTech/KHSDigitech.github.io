    * [ ] Implement player input for movement (e.g., keyboard controls).
    * [ ] Create a simple "player" object (can be a basic shape).
    * [ ] Write weekly journal entry.

* **Week 4: Core Mechanic Implementation**
  
  * **Focus:** Develop the main gameplay mechanic that makes your game unique.

    * [ ] Write weekly journal entry.

* **Week 6: Testing & Reflection**
  
  * **Focus:** Get initial feedback on the core feel of the game and reflect on the sprint.
  * **Tasks:**
    * [ ] Have at least one other person playtest the prototype.
