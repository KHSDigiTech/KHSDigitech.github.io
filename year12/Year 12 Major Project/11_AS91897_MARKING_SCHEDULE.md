| Criteria                                                                | Example of Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Using appropriate project management tools to plan the development.** | The student has a Trello board set up with lists for "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". The "To Do" list contains high-level tasks for the project (e.g., "Create Player", "Design Level").                                                                                          |
| **Decomposing the outcome into smaller components.**                    | The "Create Player" card on Trello is broken down into smaller checklist items or sub-tasks, such as "Create player sprite," "Write movement script," and "Add jump logic."                                                                                                           |
| **Trialling components of the outcome.**                                | The student writes in their weekly journal: "This week I trialled the jump mechanic. I tested that the player could jump over a simple obstacle. It worked as expected."                                                                                                              |
| **Testing that the outcome functions as intended.**                     | The student provides a video or a written summary of a friend playing the game, confirming that the game can be played from the start menu to the win/lose screen without crashing.                                                                                                   |
| **Explaining relevant implications.**                                   | In their GDD or journal, the student identifies and explains a relevant implication. For example: "An ethical implication is the use of assets. I will ensure all art and sound are either created by me or sourced from royalty-free sites to respect intellectual property rights." |

### Merit (M)

*The student uses advanced processes to develop an **informed** digital technologies outcome.*

| Criteria                                                                                               | Example of Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Effectively using project management tools to manage development.**                                  | The Trello board is actively used throughout the project. Cards are moved across lists as tasks are completed, and screenshots of the board are included in weekly journals to show progress over time.                                                                                                                      |
| **Trialling multiple components and/or techniques and selecting the most suitable.**                   | The student's journal shows they prototyped two different enemy AI behaviours (e.g., a simple patrol vs. a more complex A* pathfinding). They include a short discussion justifying their choice, e.g., "I chose A* pathfinding because it allows for more complex level designs and makes the enemy feel more intelligent." |
| **Appropriately using information from testing and trialling to improve the outcome's functionality.** | A user reports in the feedback log: "I didn't know where to go in the level." The student then creates a new task on Trello to "Add level signposting." The GitHub history shows a commit that adds arrow sprites to the level, and the journal explains how this improves the game's usability.                             |
| **Addressing relevant implications.**                                                                  | After identifying accessibility as an implication, the student implements a feature to address it. For example, they add a high-contrast text mode or allow key remapping and provide a screenshot or video of this feature working.                                                                                         |

*The student uses advanced processes to develop a **refined** digital technologies outcome.*

| Criteria                                                                                                                                  | Example of Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Discussing how information from planning, testing, and trialling of components assisted in the development of a high-quality outcome.** | The student provides a detailed reflection that connects the entire process. For example: "My initial GDD **(planning)** called for a very fast-paced game. However, my first user **(testing)** session revealed that players found the controls too difficult at high speed. I **trialled** several different gravity settings and, based on feedback, settled on a lower value. This iterative process, which started with my plan and was directly influenced by testing and trialling, was crucial in developing a high-quality outcome. The final game has much tighter, more responsive controls, which directly improved the player experience." This discussion demonstrates a clear understanding of how the process leads to a refined and superior final product. |
