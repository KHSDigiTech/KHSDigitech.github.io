This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Year 12 Major Project directory for NZQA Level 2 Digital Technologies achievement standards. The project focuses on game development to meet the requirements of:

- **AS91897**: Use advanced processes to develop a digital technologies outcome (6 credits)
- **AS91893**: Use advanced techniques to develop a digital media outcome (4 credits)

The project follows a 20-week structured development timeline with 4 sprints, each lasting approximately 4 weeks.

## Project Structure

This directory contains planning and documentation templates rather than actual code. Key document types:

### Planning Documents
- `1_PROJECT_TIMELINE.md` - 20-week development timeline
- `2_GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE.md` - Game concept and design template
- `3-6_SPRINT_*_PLAN.md` - Individual sprint planning documents
- `7_FINAL_SUBMISSION_PLAN.md` - Final submission requirements

### Assessment Documentation
- `10_ASSESSMENT_TASK.md` - Complete assessment requirements
- `11_AS91897_MARKING_SCHEDULE.md` - Digital technologies outcome marking criteria
- `12_AS91893_MARKING_SCHEDULE.md` - Digital media outcome marking criteria
- `as91893.pdf` and `as91897.pdf` - Official NZQA standards documents
- `91893-Exemplar.pdf` and `91897-Exemplar.pdf` - Annotated student exemplars

### Tracking Templates
- `8_FEEDBACK_LOG.md` - User testing feedback tracking template
- `9_WEEKLY_JOURNAL_TEMPLATE.md` - Weekly reflection template

## Development Process

The project follows an agile development methodology:

1. **Pre-production (Weeks 1-2)**: Planning, Game Design Document creation, project setup
2. **Sprint 1 (Weeks 3-6)**: Core mechanics implementation
3. **Sprint 2 (Weeks 7-10)**: Gameplay loop and UI development  
4. **Sprint 3 (Weeks 11-14)**: Art, sound, and level design
5. **Sprint 4 (Weeks 15-18)**: Polish and final features
6. **Post-production (Weeks 19-20)**: Final submission preparation

## Key Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- Game project should be set up in chosen engine/framework
- Version control through GitHub repository required
- Project management via Trello board
- Must include user testing sessions (minimum 3 formal sessions)

### Documentation Requirements
- Weekly journal entries using the provided template
- Sprint reflections at end of each 4-week cycle
- Feedback log tracking all user testing input and responses
- Final video screencast (2-3 minutes) of completed game

### Assessment Criteria
- **AS91897**: Focus on advanced development processes, planning, testing, and refinement
- **AS91893**: Focus on digital media techniques including art, sound, and user experience

## Working with This Project

When helping with this project:

1. **Respect the academic context** - This is assessment work, so provide guidance rather than complete solutions
2. **Reference the marking schedules** - Check `11_AS91897_MARKING_SCHEDULE.md` and `12_AS91893_MARKING_SCHEDULE.md` for specific requirements
3. **Support the sprint structure** - Align suggestions with the current sprint goals outlined in the relevant sprint plan
4. **Encourage documentation** - Remind about weekly journals and feedback logging as these are assessment requirements
5. **Consider both standards** - Balance technical implementation (AS91897) with digital media techniques (AS91893)

## No Build Commands

This directory contains planning documents only. Actual game development would occur in a separate project directory using the student's chosen game engine or framework (Unity, Godot, Pygame, etc.).
