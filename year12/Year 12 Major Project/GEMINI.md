# GEMINI.md

## Directory Overview

This directory contains planning, assessment, and guidance documents for a Year 12 Major Project in Digital Technologies, focusing on game development. The project is aligned with the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) Level 2 Achievement Standards AS91897 and AS91893.

The directory serves as a template and resource hub for a student undertaking this project. It includes templates for planning documents, marking schedules, and official NZQA documentation.

## Key Files

### Planning and Tracking Templates
*   `1_PROJECT_TIMELINE.md`: Outlines a 20-week development schedule, broken down into pre-production, four development sprints, and post-production.
*   `2_GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE.md`: A template for defining the game's concept, mechanics, art style, and technical specifications.
*   `3_SPRINT_1_PLAN.md` to `6_SPRINT_4_PLAN.md`: Templates for planning each four-week development sprint.
*   `8_FEEDBACK_LOG.md`: A template for recording user feedback from testing sessions.
*   `9_WEEKLY_JOURNAL_TEMPLATE.md`: A template for students to document their weekly progress and reflections.

### Assessment and Guidance
*   `10_ASSESSMENT_TASK.md`: Describes the overall assessment task, including the context, task outline, and submission requirements.
*   `11_AS91897_MARKING_SCHEDULE.md`: The marking criteria for AS91897 (Digital Technologies Outcome).
*   `12_AS91893_MARKING_SCHEDULE.md`: The marking criteria for AS91893 (Digital Media Outcome).
*   `as91893.pdf` & `as91897.pdf`: The official NZQA standards documents.
*   `91893-Exemplar.pdf` & `91897-Exemplar.pdf`: Annotated exemplars of student work.

## Development Process

The project follows a structured, agile-like methodology:

1.  **Pre-production (Weeks 1-2):** Planning, concept development, and creation of the Game Design Document.
2.  **Sprints 1-4 (Weeks 3-18):** Four-week cycles focused on iterative development, from core mechanics to final polish.
3.  **Post-production (Weeks 19-20):** Finalizing the game, preparing documentation, and submitting the project.

A key part of the process is gathering and responding to feedback, which is to be documented in the `8_FEEDBACK_LOG.md`.

## Usage

This directory is intended to be used by a student as the foundation for their Year 12 Major Project. The student should:

1.  Duplicate this directory for their own project.
2.  Complete the template markdown files (`2_GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE.md`, sprint plans, etc.) with their own project details.
3.  Use the `9_WEEKLY_JOURNAL_TEMPLATE.md` to keep a regular log of their work.
4.  Refer to the assessment documents and exemplars to ensure their work meets the required standards.

**Note:** This directory does not contain any code. The actual game development will take place in a separate project, using a game engine or framework of the student's choice.
