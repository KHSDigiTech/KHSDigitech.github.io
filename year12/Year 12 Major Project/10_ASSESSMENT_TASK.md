---

### Achievement Standards

This project assesses the following two Achievement Standards:

* **AS91897:** Use advanced processes to develop a digital technologies outcome (6 credits)
* **AS91893:** Use advanced techniques to develop a digital media outcome (4 credits)

### Context

You are an indie game developer tasked with creating a prototype for a new game. Your goal is to develop a small, polished, and complete game experience that demonstrates your skills in both project management and digital media development. You will follow a structured development process over 20 weeks to plan, create, test, and refine your game.

### Task Outline

You are required to:

1. **Plan Your Project:**
   
   * Brainstorm and select a feasible game concept.
   * Complete a **Game Design Document (GDD)** to define your game's mechanics, art style, and scope.
   * Set up a **Trello board** to manage your tasks and a **GitHub repository** for version control.

2. **Develop Your Game:**
   
   * Work through a series of four-week "sprints" to build your game incrementally.
   * Implement all core features, including player controls, gameplay mechanics, UI, and a complete gameplay loop (start to finish).
   * Create or source your own art and sound assets.

3. **Test and Refine:**
   
   * Conduct at least three formal user testing sessions to gather feedback.
   * Log all feedback and document the changes you make in response.
   * Continuously fix bugs and improve the "feel" and polish of your game.

4. **Document Your Process:**
   
   * Maintain a **Weekly Development Journal** to reflect on your progress, challenges, and learning.
   * Complete a **Sprint Reflection** at the end of each four-week cycle.

### Submission Requirements

By the end of the 20-week period, you must submit a digital portfolio containing:

* **A playable build** of your final game.
* **A video screencast** (2-3 minutes) showcasing a playthrough of your game.
* **All project planning documents**, including:
  * `2_GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE.md` (completed)
  * `8_FEEDBACK_LOG.md` (completed)
  * `9_WEEKLY_JOURNAL_TEMPLATE.md` (all entries completed)
  * All Sprint Plans with completed reflections.
* **A link to your Trello board and GitHub repository.**
