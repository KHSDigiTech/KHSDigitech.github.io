---

### Not Achieved (N)

*The student has not provided sufficient evidence to meet the Achieved criteria.*

**Example:** The game crashes on startup, uses only basic, unmodified assets from a tutorial, and has no evidence of custom code or techniques.

### Achieved (A)

*The student uses advanced techniques to develop a digital media outcome.*

| Criteria                                                                  | Example of Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Using appropriate tools and techniques for the purpose and end-users.** | The student provides the source code (e.g., C# or GDScript files) they have written to control the player character, enemies, and other game objects. This demonstrates the use of scripting, an advanced technique. |
| **Applying appropriate data integrity and testing procedures.**           | The final submitted game is playable. It can be launched, and a user can play through the core gameplay loop (e.g., start a level, play, and reach a win or lose state) without critical, game-breaking bugs.        |
| **Using relevant conventions for the media type.**                        | The student's code follows standard naming conventions (e.g., `PascalCase` for methods, `camelCase` for variables). The art assets share a consistent visual style (e.g., all pixel art is at a 32x32 resolution).   |

### Merit (M)

*The student uses advanced techniques to develop an **informed** digital media outcome.*

| Criteria                                                                                                      | Example of Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Using information from testing procedures to improve the quality of the outcome.**                          | The feedback log shows a user comment: "The game is too quiet and feels lifeless." In response, the student adds background music and sound effects for player actions (like jumping and shooting). This improves the aesthetic quality of the game.                                                             |
| **Applying relevant conventions to improve the quality of the outcome and addressing relevant implications.** | The student applies the design principle of "Feedback" by adding a visual effect (e.g., the enemy sprite flashes red) when an enemy is hit. They explain in their journal that this makes the game more intuitive and improves the quality of the experience by clearly communicating game events to the player. |

### Excellence (E)

*The student uses advanced techniques to develop a **refined** digital media outcome.*

| Criteria                                                                                                             | Example of Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **Iterative improvement throughout the design, development, and testing process to produce a high-quality outcome.** | The GitHub commit history shows the evolution of a feature. For example: Commit #1: "Add basic shooting." Commit #5: "Add recoil animation to shooting." Commit #10: "Add screen shake and particle effects to shooting." The journal explains this progression, demonstrating how the feature was iteratively improved over time to create a polished, high-quality, and satisfying ("juicy") mechanic.              |
| **Using efficient tools and techniques in the outcome's production.**                                                | The student identifies a performance issue, such as the game lagging when too many bullets are on screen. They research and implement a more efficient technique, such as an "object pool" to reuse bullet objects instead of creating and destroying them. They explain in their documentation why this technique is more efficient and how it improved the game's performance, leading to a higher-quality outcome. |
