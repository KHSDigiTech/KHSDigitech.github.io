# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a GitHub Pages repository for "King's High Digitech" (KHSDigitech.github.io). The repository appears to be in its initial state with minimal content - currently containing only a basic README.md file.

## Repository Structure

The repository is extremely minimal:
- `README.md` - Basic project title and description
- This appears to be a new GitHub Pages site that has not been developed yet

## Development Notes

This repository appears to be a fresh GitHub Pages repository that is ready for initial development. Since there are no build tools, package managers, or specific frameworks detected, this is likely intended to be either:
1. A static HTML/CSS/JavaScript website
2. A GitHub Pages site using Jekyll (which would be built automatically by GitHub)
3. A site that will use a static site generator to be added later

## Common Tasks

Since this is a GitHub Pages repository in its initial state:
- Static files can be added directly to the root directory
- GitHub Pages will automatically serve content from the main branch
- If using Jekyll, `_config.yml` and other Jekyll files would need to be added
- For custom domains, a `CNAME` file would be added to the root

## Future Development

When adding content to this repository, consider:
- Whether to use a static site generator (Jekyll, Hugo, etc.)
- Site structure and navigation requirements
- Responsive design for mobile compatibility
- SEO optimization for educational content
