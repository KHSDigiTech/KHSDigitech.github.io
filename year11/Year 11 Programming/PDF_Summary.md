# Summary of NZQA Achievement Standard AS92004 and Exemplars

This document summarizes the key information from the NZQA Achievement Standard AS92004, "Create a computer program," and its accompanying exemplars.

## AS92004: Create a computer program

This is a Level 1 achievement standard worth 5 credits. It assesses a student's ability to create a computer program.

### Key Requirements:

* **Achievement:**
  * Create a computer program that performs a specified task.
  * Use a suitable programming language.
  * Test and debug the program for expected cases.
  * Document the program with comments.
* **Achievement with Merit:**
  * Create a *well-structured* computer program.
  * Use succinct and descriptive variable names.
  * Document with comments that clarify the purpose of code sections.
  * Test and debug for expected and *boundary* cases.
* **Achievement with Excellence:**
  * Create a *flexible and robust* computer program.
  * Use conditions and control structures effectively.
  * Use constants, variables, or derived values instead of literals to make the program flexible.
  * Test and debug for expected, boundary, and *invalid* cases.

### The computer program must:

* Store at least two types of data in variables.
* Take input from a user, sensor, or other external source.
* Produce output.
* Use sequence, selection, and iteration control structures.
* Use data stored in a collection.

## Exemplars

The exemplars provide concrete examples of student work that meet the different grade levels.

### Achieved Exemplar:

* **Project:** A Python quiz about NRL (National Rugby League).
* **Features:**
  * Stores data in integers and strings.
  * Takes user input.
  * Uses `if` statements and `while` loops.
  * Stores questions and answers in arrays.
  * Includes basic testing and debugging.
  * Has comments throughout the code.

### Merit Exemplar:

* **Project:** A Python quiz about family reunions.
* **Features:**
  * Uses succinct variable names (e.g., `questions`).
  * Has comments that describe the purpose of code sections.
  * Includes testing for expected and boundary cases.

### Excellence Exemplar:

* **Project:** A Python quiz about Pandora's Box from Greek Mythology.
* **Features:**
  * Uses methods to structure the code and minimize repetition.
  * Uses a `for` loop to cycle through questions, making it easy to add more.
  * Includes testing for invalid values (e.g., long strings of "b"s).
  * Uses `if` statements to validate input.

In summary, the documents provide a clear framework for a programming assessment, with the exemplars offering practical guidance on how to meet the standard at different levels of proficiency.
