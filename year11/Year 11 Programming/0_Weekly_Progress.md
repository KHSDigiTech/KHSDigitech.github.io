This document provides a high-level overview of the 10-week lesson plan designed to take absolute beginners to a point where they can successfully complete the **AS92004 Simple Contact Book** assessment.

| Week | Topic                                   | Key Skills Learned                                                    | Relation to Final Assessment                                         |
| :--- | :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Intro to Programming & Data Types       | `print()`, `input()`, variables, strings, `int()`, type conversion    | Getting user input and understanding why it might need converting.   |
| 2    | Conditional Logic & String Formatting   | `if/elif/else`, comparison operators, f-strings                       | Building the menu and creating clean, readable output.               |
| 3    | Introduction to Lists                   | Creating lists, `append()`, `pop()`, `remove()`, accessing by index   | Storing the collection of contacts.                                  |
| 4    | Iteration (Loops)                       | `while` loops, `for` loops, `break`                                   | Creating the main menu loop and viewing all contacts.                |
| 5    | Structuring Data (Dictionaries)         | Creating dictionaries, accessing values, `.items()`, `del`            | (Merit) Storing contact data in a well-structured way.               |
| 6    | Error Handling                          | `try...except` blocks to handle errors gracefully                     | (Excellence) Making the program robust by handling invalid user input. |
| 7    | Functions & Documentation               | `def`, parameters, `return`, comments vs. docstrings                  | (Excellence) Structuring code for flexibility and reusability.       |
| 8-10 | Project Development & Refinement        | Applying all concepts, debugging, documentation, and final testing    | Completing the final assessment to a high standard over 3 weeks.     |
